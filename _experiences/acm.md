ACM is one of the largest student organizations at SCU. We strongly encourage and welcome students of all backgrounds, majors, and skill levels to join us and share our love for technology! At SCU's ACM, we present informative workshops, bring guest speakers, and host fun weekly meetings, as well as hackathons.

My involvement in ACM includes being Underclass Rep for my first year at SCU. My job was to help out wherever possible, but mostly to be an attentive member and bring a new perspective to our board. Feedback is something we highly value at ACM and having underclassmen to represent our members is a great way to realize this. I then transitioned to Workshop Coordinator for my second year. I planned our weekly Tuesday meetings to teach our members technologies not normally taught in class. I learned a lot through this process as I taught topics such as Python, React, and even hosting a full stack web app! This year, I am honored to be the Vice President of ACM, which allows me to represent the vision and direction of this wonderful club. I will continue to teach workshops, but I will now take a more central role in communication with higher ups, our sponsoring companies, and seeing over all aspects of ACM. I hope to become President next year for my last year at SCU!
