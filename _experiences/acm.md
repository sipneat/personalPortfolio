ACM is one of the largest student organizations at SCU. We strongly encourage and welcome students of all backgrounds, majors, and skill levels to join us and share our love for technology! At SCU's ACM, we present informative workshops, bring guest speakers, and host fun weekly meetings, as well as hackathons.

My involvement in ACM includes being Underclass Rep for my first year at SCU. My job was to help out wherever possible, but mostly to be an attentive member and bring a new perspective to our board. Feedback is something we highly value at ACM and having underclassmen to represent our members is a great way to realize this. Currently, I am Vice President for my third year, supporting the President and making decisions that impact the club as a whole and our image on campus. Previously, I was the Workshop Coordinator, where I planned our weekly Tuesday meetings to teach our members technologies not normally taught in class. Not only have I helped others, but I have learned a lot through this process as I tend to teach topics such as Python, React, and even hosting a full stack web app! This has been an amazing experience and I can't wait to see how me, along with our entire team, will contribute this year!
