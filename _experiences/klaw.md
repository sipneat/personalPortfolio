At Khatami Law, our family lawyers in Roseville provide effective representation to individuals, couples, and families throughout the Sacramento region. We are well-versed in the areas of family law, personal injury, and civil litigation. Although there are plenty of firms out there, we believe that our commitment to your goals, courtroom experience, and determined representation set us apart.

My role at Khatami Law started as a File Clerk, ensuring that the physical and online files were in the right places, as well as helping out wherever I was needed. I slowly evolved my role into something more technical and transitioned into an IT Support role. I supported employees 100+ miles away and handled network problems, software and hardware issues, and more. I also started developing PDFScanScript for this role, which sought to minimize the time spent identifying and organizing documents.
