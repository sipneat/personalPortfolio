Philips Hue is a line of color-changing LED lamps and white bulbs which can be controlled wirelessly. The Philips Hue line of bulbs was the first smart bulb of its kind on the market and has since gained compatibility with other smart home systems such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. The lamps are currently created and manufactured by Signify.

This role has seen me push multiple features to our 1M+ daily active user base for our partnerships team, which handles connections with Amazon, Google, and Samsung. I translated an entire type of feature, start to finish, to all of our partner platforms in less than 2 months of joining. I'm currently in this role, so expect more in the future!
