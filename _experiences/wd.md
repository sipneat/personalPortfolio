We are a key partner to some of the largest and highest growth organizations in the world. From energizing the most competitive gaming platforms, to enabling systems to make cities safer and cars smarter and more connected, to powering the data centers behind many of the world’s biggest companies and public cloud, Western Digital is fueling a brighter, smarter future.

This role helped me grow into using real DevOps technologies that have altered the course of my career forever. I created a hardware reservation system with Django and Jenkins LockableResources to facilitate the sharing of hardware by multiple difference teams across different locations. Complete with Ansible pipelines to configure said resources, Prometheus + Grafana containerized stacks to monitor resource usage, and full compatibility with existing Jenkins regression pipelines, I learned a lot about on-prem resources and how to navigate maintaining fully operational infrastructure and all of its quirks.
