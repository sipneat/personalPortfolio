CMG Financialâ€™s lending philosophy focuses on making sure borrowers get not just a mortgage, but that they get the right solution to fit their broader financial goals. Privately held by Christopher M. George, they maintain the original culture and business model of low overhead, competitive pricing, and extraordinary service.

I am working as a DevOps Engineering Intern for CMG with some IT Support work on the side. I started with handling intake and outtake of laptops and other devices, creating a streamlined and documented process for when someone else needs to take over the job. I also created an update script using Visual Basic to automate the updating of laptops, ensuring they are logged correctly in our various tracking systems. I began coding with the DevOps team shortly after, where I started by creating a work intake form to handle new feature requests. I followed up on these by creating a full web portal, complete with dynamic features and smooth syling and navigation. This Angular frontend and Flask backend interacted with several different APIs, including Microsoft Azure, O365 mail servers, and login logic using MSAL and OAuth. All of this is deployed using Azure and automated using robust pipelining features. I both learned new skills and enhanced old ones working at CMG and would love to continue this path of learning in an internship in 2025!
