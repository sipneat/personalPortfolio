CMG Financialâ€™s lending philosophy focuses on making sure borrowers get not just a mortgage, but that they get the right solution to fit their broader financial goals. Privately held by Christopher M. George, they maintain the original culture and business model of low overhead, competitive pricing, and extraordinary service.

I did so well at this internship that they rehired me for the school year! I worked remote and split this role with schoolwork, which made me learn a lot about time management. Not only did I continue my web portal app, but I started to do more work for other dev teams like setting up Dockerfiles, creating pipelines with Terraform, and handling the everyday tasks of being on a DevOps team.
