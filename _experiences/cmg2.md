Privately held by Christopher M. George, they maintain the original culture and business model of low overhead, competitive pricing, and extraordinary service.

I did so well at this internship that they rehired me for the school year! I currently work remote and split this role with schoolwork and I haven't looked back. Not only am I continuing my web portal app, but I've started to do more work for other dev teams like setting up Dockerfiles, creating pipelines, and handling the everyday tasks of being on a DevOps team. I'm currently working in this role, so more information to come!
