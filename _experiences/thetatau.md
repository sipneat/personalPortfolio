Founded at the University of Minnesota in 1904, Theta Tau is the nation's oldest and foremost Fraternity for Engineers. Over 30,000 have been initiated over the years. With emphasis on quality and a strong fraternal bond, the fraternity has chapters only at ABET accredited schools. Theta Tau carefully follows a program in the selection and development of its members that stresses the importance of high professional ethics and exemplary practices.

My contributions to Theta Tau started with my pledge class in my first year as Fundraising Chair. I was responsible for leading the effort to raise $5500 during our 7 week pledge process, which went to our active chapter. After that, I was initiated as a normal member, but I am seeking leadership roles in the near future!
