  content:
      I've been playing baseball since I was 8 years old, and I can truly say it has shaped me into the person I am today.
      I have played the catcher position my entire life, which involves putting on the gear and sitting behind the plate,
      catching the pitches from the pitcher. This may seem boring, but I control what pitch is thrown to each batter,
      keeping in mind the last time they were up to bat. I also command the whole field, as I am the only defender that can see the whole field
      and I can make decisions on where the ball should go based on the runners. Baseball is one of my greatest teachers of
      learning, failure, teamwork, leadership, and much more. If you are interested in this wonderful sport, feel free to reach out as I love to talk about it!

      My car interest started with my first car, a lifted Chevrolet Colorado. My dad and I made some slight modifications,
      such as putting in a cold air intake and replacing the exhaust, which made this such a fun truck to drive. My dad then got an Infiniti Q50S,
      which taught me how much fun speed could be. This twin turbo V6 got me into watching racing sports such as F1 and MotoGP and doing more research into the car world.
      I was then inspired by my dad to pick up a motorcycle, as he raced back in the day. I fell in love with my Ducati Monster 696 and enjoyed the thrill of 2 wheels.
      I currently have a tuned 2013 Mercedes C250, that boasts a surprisingly quick turbo inline 4. I am always looking to learn more and hope to get into racing some day!
