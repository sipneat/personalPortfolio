This project was born from a need in my CS community. We use a website called when2meet to find times to meet for various events, but this tool has no integrations with any calendar apps. It also requires you to enter your free times, which can be difficult to keep track of. So, I made this simple extension using Google Calendar to fill in your open times automatically.

There were 2 major components to this project. The first was handling the Google Authentication using OAuth 2.0, which further enhanced my learning of keep credentials secure and the auth pipeline. The second was the web scraping to click the elements on the webpage, which had challenges due to the extension nature of this project. After some time, I can say that most of my friends and peers in ACM use this extension and it has made our lives easier. If you want to see it in action, take a look at the Google Chrome Store link above!
