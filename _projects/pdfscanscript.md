PDF Scan Script was created with a simple goal: automate an already existing part of our workflow at Khatami Law. Working for an attorney may not seem like the best place to hone my technical skills, but I noticed a way I could make that a reality. The script works by processing the thousands of PDFs attorneys get per day and looking for things such as the clientâ€™s name, date, title of the document, signed or stamped, and much more. 

I learned Python in the process, taking advantage of the powerful OpenCV library to enhance accuracy using Computer Vision. I also implemented several smart features, such as a queue for the files and accounting for upper and lowercasing. Although this project is not quite ready for industry use, I hope to refine it even more to save time for attorneys across the country.
