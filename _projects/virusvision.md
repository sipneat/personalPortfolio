Our inspiration for Virus Vision comes from the desire to leverage technology for disease surveillance and solutions. Virus Vision aims to offer a detailed and current overview of global health threats, with a current focus on Covid and Influenza. Our objective is to enhance disease awareness and treatment by showcasing disease spread and density relative to population, simplifying complex data for the public. This includes highlighting relevant news articles and guiding users to nearby hospitals and clinics related to the targeted disease.

I worked on the front end and back end of this project. For the front end, I created the welcome page, map page, news feed, styling, and routing for the website. I also worked on connecting all the components to each other. For the back end, I created the algorithm for spreading out or data from regions to cities and compilied our disease and popualation data into 1 JSON file for the front end to read!
