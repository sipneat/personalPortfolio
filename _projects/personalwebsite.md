Creating this website started with a workshop taught by our 2023-2024 ACM President, Jordan. He spoke on the different ways to make a website, how important having a personal portfolio is, even how to buy your own domain and host it online. I was particularly drawn to the section of static site frameworks and chose to start this project using Jekyll. Based on Ruby, it has many of the component-style functions that React has, without all of the reactivity and bloat that isn’t needed for a simple portfolio website

So, I got to work, learning the ins-and-outs of markdown, styling, aspect ratio considerations, and much more. I’m also hosting this website on my own personal hardware, making this project truly my own creation!
