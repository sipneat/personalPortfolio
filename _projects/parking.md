Parking++ is a web app that aims to help you find parking suitable to your needs. Users can input the location, and the output is the distance from destination, cost, and availability of the parking. Then, the user can use Google Street View to preview where they can park, essentially creating a user friendly environment to solve all their parking needs.

I worked on the backend by creating our Flask proxy API to query INRIX and Google Maps APIs. I also connected the backend data to the frontend map display, which taught me a lot about connecting the 2 sides of a web app!
