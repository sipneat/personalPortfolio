The DevOps Lab is a personal project that I created to learn about DevOps practices and tools. I follow a set plan to take me through learning the pipeline and infrastructure tools to build off of my full-stack development experience. The end goal is to host this website by myself, complete with a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, a containerized environment, and even using my own hardware. Although DevOps is mostly learned on the job, having an environment to play around with is a great way for me to learn the tools and practices that I will be using in the future.
